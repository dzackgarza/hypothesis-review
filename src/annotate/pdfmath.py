"""Recover clean LaTeX for PDF annotations that span rendered math.

A PDF carries no embedded LaTeX (unlike LaTeXML HTML): selecting an equation yields the
flattened text layer, which loses 2D structure and can silently corrupt it — ``½`` read
as ``12``, a fraction shattered across lines. The only recovery is OCR of the rendered
region.

A Hypothesis PDF annotation carries the page (``PageSelector.index``) and the selected
text. We fetch the PDF, render that page, crop the bounding box of the selection —
located from the page's own words, so every line it spans is captured at the text
column's width — and OCR the crop with Mathpix -> clean ``$…$`` LaTeX. This mirrors
:mod:`annotate.mathquote` for the HTML case; like it, it cleans only the *agent's* copy —
the stored selectors (anchoring) are never touched.
