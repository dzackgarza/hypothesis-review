"""Owned-logic tests for the PDF math normalizer.

The OCR itself is Mathpix's correctness, proven out-of-band. What this module owns, and
what these tests prove, is: locating the annotation's region as the bounding box of the
selected text — every line it spans, at the text column's width — so the right slice of
the page is what gets OCR'd, and trimming the OCR back to the selection. On a locating
miss, the honest raw quote is kept instead of the wrong region. Region logic runs against
a real PyMuPDF document with text at known positions: a real boundary, no network, no OCR.
